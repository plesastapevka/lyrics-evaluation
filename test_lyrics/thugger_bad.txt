Wheezy outta here
Rose gold seat on a fucking helicopter
Double C, no Chanel, 'cause she bad, bad, bad
Ridin' Kawasaki, I could cop you a new 'Rari
Let you ride it in your Rafs and you're bad, bad, bad
No playin', no Atari, I won't play with you for nothing
I can eat you like Hibachi 'cause you're bad, bad, bad
I just took the doors off the 'Ghini, now I'm riding
And I'm sliding in her, sideways, now she call me her Zaddy
Rich nigga shit, I bought my thottie a new Patek
Got a model, got a thickie, got a BM, got a stallion
Got a billion dollar corporation, fuck a Xanny
I got millions to go get and a couple bitches to uh, yeah
You my dawg 'til we dead, not a question
But I can't fuck with you like I want 'cause you ratted
Got a million dollars in the wall, in the Bentley
Got a step down, got it hard, got it cracking on her
Half a million, I just need a warm up
For half a million, uh, uh, mm, I could buy the building
I could rent this shit out or save it for the children
I could deck this shit out or give it to the villains
Somewhere they can hide when they do some killing
All of the rides got grenade ceilings
Loaded with a ride cost a cool million
Rose gold seat on a fucking helicopter
Double C, no Chanel, 'cause she bad, bad, bad
Ridin' Kawasaki, I could cop you a new 'Rari
Let you ride it in your Rafs and you're bad, bad, bad
No playin', no Atari, I won't play with you for nothing
I can eat you like Hibachi 'cause you're bad, bad, bad
I just took the doors off the 'Ghini, now I'm riding
And I'm sliding in her, sideways, now she call me her Zaddy
Paper tag, peanut butter seats, I'm ridin'
I be in the foreign, I fuck with slime, we tatted (Slatt)
Different color Diors on my feet, I couldn't decide which
Never tap the baddest, she done make that set my side bitch
Trash bag gang, I can put that on the logic
Street shows me, I ain't never had to sign up
Then we hand bitches in the group, I make 'em line up
Beep, beep, beep, that's me, nigga, get back
Real dope boy, don't know how to work a CashApp
How many you got? I'll send it alone, I'ma cash out
I been sipping lean 'bout to pee, 'til I pass out
Went to sleep apartment, woke up in the paradise
Niggas stealin' drip but it don't matter, they don't wear it right
They don't even speak but I can see I got 'em terrified
Double R truck, come through, shit on everybody
Bad, bad, bitch, good head, hit her every night
Rose gold seat on a fucking helicopter
Double C, no Chanel, 'cause she bad, bad, bad
Ridin' Kawasaki, I could cop you a new 'Rari
Let you ride it in your Rafs and you're bad, bad, bad
No playin', no Atari, I won't play with you for nothing
I can eat you like Hibachi 'cause you're bad, bad, bad
I just took the doors off the 'Ghini, now I'm riding
And I'm sliding in her, sideways, now she call me her Zaddy
Take the four doors off of the jeep (Bad, bad, bad)
I ain't doin' no swaps with the freak, uh (Bad, bad, bad)
We can handle this shit out in the streets, yeah (Bad, bad, bad)
I ain't goin' to her house for a meeting (Bad, bad, bad)
Pull up in a truck, in a ceilin'
Niggas never coming out, it ain't leaving
How could nigga take a loss if he leaving?
Quickly take off like I'm LeBron
