KimJ with the heat
Yung Ting, you goin' crazy
(Crazy, crazy)
Play the block, play the block, repeat
That's all a young nigga learned from these streets
I was, in the trenches with my soldiers, had to stay poled up
They don't know the gang, give a fuck 'bout what they told us
And they gon' try somethin' 'cause they fully for the clout
I know a couple niggas wanna do me for the clout
Anytime you try somethin', for a fact it's goin' south
Any sudden movements and the toolie comin' out
And we gon' let it ring til' these niggas learn they lesson
APM that's the gang, time to apply the pressure
Man we ain't have a thing, opportunity's a blessing
All we know is gun shots and a couple stretchers
I don't think you know how it feels, nah, nah
To live and go to school in the field, nah, nah
But I'ma stand tall, won't kneel, nah, nah
It's only the survival of the real, nah, nah, nah
And I came out strong
Music my only hope, this is where I belong
I don't know what's next, I just keep makin' songs
And sing about my pain 'cause I know they can relate
To what I gotta say
You ain't never been outside, man this shit, it ain't a game
All we wanted was to strive, APM ain't a gang
But my nigga gon' ride for whatever we claim, nah, nah, nah, nah
Went from the deuce, deuce to the 9 millimeter
Used to spin Hondas now we slide in two-seaters
I'm only one stripe away from the Adidas
Now these opp niggas keep askin' for a feature
Lyrics is my bible, in the booth I'm a preacher
Fightin' some demons I shake 'em off like a seizure
Between hell and a cell, I choose neither
Shoutout to my fans and my believers
I don't think you know how it feels, nah, nah
To live and go to school in the field, nah, nah
But I'ma stand tall, won't kneel, nah, nah
It's only the survival of the real, nah, nah, nah
But I gotta stay strong
This is where I belong, oh, oh, oh
I don't think you know how it feels, nah, nah
To live and go to school in the field, nah, nah
But I'ma stand tall, won't kneel, nah, nah
It's only the survival of the real, nah, nah, nah
But I gotta stay strong
This is where I belong, oh, oh, oh
Sold nickels and dimes because I had to
Got involved with crime 'cause I had to
Gave it all my time 'cause I had to
To the top I gotta climb and I plan to
Retro, that's my guy, Ken my mans too
We all gon' shine 'cause we had to
Man this music shit a sign, so we had to
'Cause we had to, fuck it 'cause we had to
Play the block, play the block, repeat
That's all a young nigga learned from these streets
I was, in the trenches with my soldiers, had to stay poled up
They don't know the gang, give a fuck 'bout what they told us
And they gon' try somethin' 'cause they fully for the clout
I know a couple niggas wanna do me for the clout
Anytime you try somethin', for a fact it's goin' south
Any sudden movements and the toolie comin' out
And we gon' let it ring til' these niggas learn they lesson
APM that's the gang, time to apply the pressure
Man we ain't have a thing, opportunity's a blessing
All we know is gun shots and a couple stretchers
I don't think you know how it feels, nah, nah
To live and go to school in the field, nah, nah
But I'ma stand tall, won't kneel, nah, nah
It's only the survival of the real, nah, nah, nah
But I gotta stay strong
This is where I belong, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
It's Melvoni, yeah
