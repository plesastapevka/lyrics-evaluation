I like to do what I wanna do

Came up on a couple of million, uh
I ain't 'bout status and billions
Look at my money, it tripled
Shit getting realer and realer, uh
I lost my bro to the system, uh
I lost my bro to a pistol, uh
They tried to take me with him, uh
I can't go for that, no, no
I stay with killers every day
Keep a 40, it's hungry
I turn yo block to a buffet
Yeah, I spend a lot
Balenciaga jacket, Dior shades
I got a lean stain on it, I'ma give it to my maid
Uh, people love to talk about the money that they make
Nobody wanna talk about the money that they save
Who am I to talk about it? I blow money every day
'Cause I know when you die, you can't take the shit to your grave

Versace drawers, my underwear cost what you make in a week
Uh, big shit, expensive shit, all that shit

Uh, big shit, expensive shit, all that shit
Only wanna fuck one time baby, I'm on the fall back shit
Matter fact, you wanna fuck her
But you on the call back list
But if I hit it already, chances are I ain't gonna call back, bitch
Shit getting realer and realer, uh
Came up on a couple of million, uh

Look at my money, it tripled
Shit getting realer and realer, uh
I lost my bro to the system, uh
